### Authors: James Dansie and Jon Veach
This project will read a JSON file and parse it for authors and text. It will return a random quote and its author. To test the file run "./gradlew test". To run the file run "./gradlew run". The project will now grab ron swanson quotes from the internet, and if they are are unique it will store them to the json file.
